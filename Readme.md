Install k3s on your system ( k3s server )
install docker on your system 


What I have done in docker compose : 

it itself setup the postgress path , 
postgres image it will itself fetch but 
u just only have to give correct path on your system where to store the postgress data

bisque image , first you have to build the workspace to get the bisque image 
it itself setup the bisque path, 
pass the correct bisque built image name on your system ! 
u just only have to give the correct path on your system to database where it stores the bisque uploaded data !
